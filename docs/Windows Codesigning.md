# Windows Codesigning

Twine App Builder supports signing Windows builds. This step is fully optional, but will remove the "untrusted publisher" warning message that Windows may show upon running your game. If you're primarily publishing on Steam, this may not be necessary, as this warning does not show up for games launched via the Steam launcher.

This requires a Windows developer certificate, which costs around $150/year depending on who you buy it from.
